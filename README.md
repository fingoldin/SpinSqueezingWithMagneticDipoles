# Data and analysis code for 2024 paper "Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles"

## Processed data

All data shown in the paper figures, processed into .csv files, are in the folder `final_data`.

## Analysis layout

The `2024_paper` folder contains all the code for data analysis and figure generation for the 2024 paper "Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles".

`ProcessLogFiles.ipnyb` processes the raw scan files into `data/.
The main analysis is found in `Analysis.ipnyb`. This uses the processed scan data stored in `data/`.

There is also some additional data in `meanfielddata/`, which is used for the mean field shearing plots in Figure 2. There are two datasets:
- 100 ms mean-field shearing, from scan #145 of May 6, 2023 (experimental data and DTWA)
- 1000 ms mean-field shearing, from scan #77 of December 5, 2023 (DTWA only)

Some older mean-field data for the WAHUHA and lattice loss figures are found in `an_data/`.

The cached DTWA data is found in `dtwa`. All this data is generated by the code in `Analysis.ipnyb`.

The final paper figures are in `final_figures/`. These are stored as Inkscape SVGs and also as PDFs.

The `other/` directory contains some additional figure-drawing scripts, for some of the paper figures.
